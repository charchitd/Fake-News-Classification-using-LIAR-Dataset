# Fake-News-Classification-using-LIAR-Dataset

1.1) Fact-checking is the process of assessing the veracity of claims. It requires identifying
evidence from trusted sources, understanding the context, and reasoning about what can
be inferred from the evidence. Several organizations such as FACTCHECK.org, POLITIFACT.com and FULLFACT.org are devoted to such activities, and the final verdict can
reflect varying degrees of truth (e.g., POLITIFACT labels claims as true, mostly true, half
true, mostly false, false and pants on fire).
