## Six-Way Classification

With continuous increase in available data, there is a pressing need to organize it
and modern classification problems often involve the prediction of multiple labels simultaneously associated with a single instance. Known as Multi-Label Classification, it is one such
task which is omnipresent in many real world problems.Here we are classifying the data by
using again Random Forest as random forest classifier is so much flexible to train multiple
label datasets.

* Here by using Bag of words we are achieving the Accuracy: 28 percent
